All notable changes to the Financial Time Series Analysis Platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-02

### Changed

#### AI Advisory System - Dynamic Recommendations
- **Replaced hardcoded rules with true AI-powered analysis**
  - Frontend now uses actual AI responses instead of static if-then rules
  - Backend passes full configuration context to AI service (GPT-4/Claude)
  - AI analyzes specific parameter combinations and provides tailored advice
  
- **Enhanced Analysis Context**
  - Added `additional_context` field to AnalysisContext dataclass
  - Full configuration details sent to AI for comprehensive analysis
  - Improved prompt engineering for parameter-specific recommendations
  
- **Real-time Configuration Assistant**
  - Analysis page displays AI recommendations that update as parameters change
  - Debounced API calls for optimal performance
  - Loading states and error handling for better UX
  
- **Optimal Configuration Extraction**
  - AI responses parsed to extract suggested parameter values
  - Support for all analysis types (IDTxl, ML, Neural Networks)
  - Context-aware optimization based on dataset characteristics

### Fixed
- AI Advisor now provides PhD-level expertise based on actual analysis, not generic rules
- Configuration recommendations are specific to symbols, timeframes, and parameter values
- Removed misleading hardcoded advice that didn't consider actual configuration
